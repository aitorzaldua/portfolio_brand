                vaya n open-source framework for creating peer-to-peer applications that are secure, reliable, and fast. Instead of depending on servers, Holochain applications connect user devices directly to each other in secure networks. This gives users the best of both worlds â€” the autonomy and availability of locally installed software, with the power and redundancy of cloud software. Application developers, in turn, no longer have to maintain and pay for cloud hosting.

                Substrate is the perfect framework to build your blockchain. Using Substrate&#39;s palettes you can easily create whatever you want, or create your own custom logic. Either way, Substrate makes building a blockchain much faster, easier and more secure than ever. Substrate is Smart Contract Ready. It has a Wasm smart contract platform touse out of the box. Because Substrate uses Wasm, you can build your smart contracts using any compatible language. Substrate have built ink, a Rust-based eDSL, for this purpose.
