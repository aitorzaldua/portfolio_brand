We are very excited to announce our investment into [PrimeDAO’s](https://www.prime.xyz/) $2 million dollar seed round. The PrimeDAO builders are at the forefront of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) innovation and it is exciting to be along for the ride.

Our belief is that the openness and transparency offered by DAOs will transform the way organizations are structured. From corporations to governments, DAOs offer a truly democratic method for group consensus and decision making. Today’s DAOs are just scratching the surface of what will be a revolution. The keys to this revolution succeeding are the tools being built today.

PrimeDAO is one of those key pieces. DAOs will end up needing to coordinate in much of the same way businesses do. DAO to DAO (D2D) cooperation and interactions will become commonplace. PimeDAO is building tools that allow for these interactions. From joint ventures to token swaps and token launches, PrimeDAO is pioneering the D2D space.

PrimeDAO Deals Demo Interface:

PrimeDAO will soon launch four of its major tools:

Deals — An interface which allows for the creation of agreements between DAOs. (Joint ventures, token swaps, etc.)

Pools — Liquidity pools governed by the DAOs. Can bridge liquidity between allied ecosystems.

Launch — Decentralized token launches built on top of Balancer V2 LBPs.

Rating — Permissionless rating system gauging risk and quality of digital assets.

The purpose of each of these is to expand and improve the toolkit for DAOs and decentralized applications. The Deals interface is particularly interesting as it will enable D2D collaboration. This has previously not been possible.

PrimeDAO is made up of some of the most important DAO contributors in the space. With supporters from API3, Curve Labs, Balancer, and many others; PrimeDAO is poised to become a powerhouse in the DAO community.

We are very optimistic on PrimeDAO’s role in DAO evolution and are excited to be contributing to the community. If you want to get involved with PrimeDAO or have an idea for collaboration, share it in their Discord and follow them on Twitter.
