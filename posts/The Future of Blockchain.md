I recently wrote an article about Holochain and Network Effect, if you haven't read it you can check it out [here](https://cloudthings.medium.com/holochain-holofuel-the-network-effect-explained-ecd4c933f12a)

In that article I delve into what is needed and how it can be achieved for Holochain to succeed due to network affect.

I also touched on the reasons blockchain cannot achieve that critical mass of users because there is so many competing blockchains and even though most of them do more or less the same thing (which isn’t much) they continue to just exist for the hell of it.

They don’t actually solve any problems or bring about global change for the better. Rather its an unregulated financial mess that has jurisdictions around the world looking at things from different angles and stand points.

So what’s my point?

The main point I want to share with you in this article is to look at where blockchain is likely to be in 2,5, or even 10 years from now.

Some may say “who cares, you don’t know what’s going to happen”, and they would be correct in saying that. But if you are investing your money into something now wouldn't it be wise or even prudent to ponder what the future will hold?

I’m also going to discuss how I think HoloFuel will be received and the likely relationship of price with the HOT token.

## Blockchain is over valued


Lets get that out there straight up, the prices for blockchain cryptocurrencies are totally ridiculous when you consider what you are actually buying and what it then does for you as an owner or “consumer”.

Try and look at it from this mindset, it helps to have a reality check sometimes.

One Litecoin does the same thing when its valued at $5.00 as it does when its valued at $185.00.

One Bitcoin does the same thing at $200.00 as it does at $50,000.00.

One Polkadot, one SOL etc all do the same thing at any price because they don’t have an intrinsic value.

Stock traders use intrinsic value to determine if a stock is over or under priced, with the main goal being to gain value while investing is to seek out stocks that are trading for less than their intrinsic value.

But how can you put an intrinsic value on something that doesn’t have a revenue, doesn’t have turnover, doesn’t have any assets backing it?

Blockchain only achieves its value or discovers its price by what the market does, and this market is heavily manipulated.

Its a perfect place to launder money, steal from those whom are new to cryptocurrency, hack smart contracts, phishing scams, you name it, blockchain has it.

Blockchain is an unregulated industry that has no product itself other than the coins or tokens its selling, the people who make money regardless of the price is the miners, the stakers and the exchanges.
If you own blockchain coins or tokens picture a triangle with your head in the middle of it.

At the top is the exchanges, bottom left is the miners, bottom right is the stakers, you and your money are in the middle with a big (sucker) lightbulb above your head showing because you are paying every corner of the triangle for the privilege of owning something that has no intrinsic value, is highly volatile and charges you every time you want to do something.

That’s the system, blockchain just takes and takes, sure people make money with the buy low — sell high mantra and of course it works for some but the majority lose out.

In a way blockchain also resembles coronavirus, each government has its own way of dealing with it, no one can control it, people suffer, others deny its impact but mostly anything associated with it is negative, just like blockchain.

The other similarity is education, people push their view on coronavirus just as hard as they push their views on any particular blockchain coin or token and then you have some media saying one thing about coronavirus pushing a theme or agenda and other media saying the complete opposite, sound familiar?

Its an eternal point of view argument that takes place daily on Twitter and other social media for both blockchain and Covid19.

## Where will blockchain be in 12 months or 5 years?


To me that’s an easy question to answer logically, but logic and blockchain don’t co-exist very well.

The real world media now follows blockchain and uses a lot of it as “filler” news now rather than actually featuring it.

On the other hand the cryptocurrency media are one big propaganda machine. In particular Cointelegraph you can tell it is owned by a conglomerate of Miners because no matter how red the charts are dripping with blood they will push the propaganda out 24/7.

Coindesk are not quite as bad as they used to be, they are owned by the digital currency group and tend to promote (of course without any obvious disclaimers) the coins and tokens where the DCG has an interest.

Forbes Crypto and Bloomberg are all in the same boat, they do paid for (backroom handshakes and transactions) advertising dressed up as a story.

Why I’m saying this is for those that are unaware the entire industry is manipulated and packed up with a ribbon on it so they can sell sell sell.

Because no blockchain cryptocurrency is actually tangible or asset backed the product is the coin/token itself and whatever shit they have plugged into it to make it seem useful.

Smart Contracts, NFT’s, Defi are all just selling points all of the blockchains use to convince you this is the future.

I think it couldn’t be further from the truth.

One day more people will wake up and see blockchain for what it is, they'll learn the hard way that paying gas fees, transaction fees, staking costs, dealing with 20 to 50 percent ups and downs is not “normal” at all, its a faux world of finance where the only product is the idiot that buys it and contributes to it.

And yes I just called people invested in blockchain idiots, I was once one of those idiots myself until I decided to take a step back and look at the entire industry as a whole.

Until people take their own step backwards or take the time to try and understand what it is they are putting their money into then they remain the perfect client for the suckers triangle.

To answer the question of the heading where will blockchain bein 12 months or 5 years, it is entirely dependent on how long they can keep the suckers in the loop.

They say there is one born every minute so with that as a guide, could be a while. But seriously I think sooner rather than later people will realize that the whole scarcity thing is bullshit and used to sell coins and tokens.

They’ll also eventually understand that there is no need for miners or stakers to ensure stringent transaction security, that is a very old technology.

I think the longer Bitcoin sits near 50 thousand USD at the time of writing this article the higher the chances are its going to mega dump.

The miners and exchanges do most of the dumping then their propaganda outlets, the cryptocurrency media and influencer propaganda immediately switches into “Buy the dip”, or “Gas fees are the lowest since…” all of the usual bullshit they put out every time, just after they have financially raped 1/3 of all cryptocurrency holders.

It just cannot keep going the way it is now, I think eventually even though its a jurisdictional challenge eventually bigger countries will legislate much of it into oblivion with the assistance of banks requiring them to only accept funds from exchanges that comply with a particular countries legislation.

That’s another reason privacy coins will die first, they are the biggest to launder money then people jump onto unregulated exchanges or use mixing sites to swap anonymously to eventually cash out.

Its a partially criminal operation operating with impunity for the most part but again I think technology and legislation will put it in its place.
