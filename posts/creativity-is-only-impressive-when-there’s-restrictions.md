Smart contracts are powering a wave of unstoppable innovation that will eventually disrupt every industry that exists today, as well as creating many new industries of the future. 

But for all this promise, there is still so much more capacity for smart contract development than is taking place right now. Quite simply, this is because smart contract development is hard. It requires specialist skills that few people have. It involves security auditing, so everyone can trust in this autonomous financial technology. Crucially, smart contracts also need to be combined with strong incentives and community engagement to capture users’ attention.

Finding ways to clear these barriers to entry is not easy but the rewards are clear. You only have to look at the burgeoning DeFi scene and projects such as Uniswap, Compound, and Yearn to see how powerful this new technology can be.

So, if we want to see this wave of innovation expand into other industries, these barriers need to fall. While it won’t be simple, one of the clearest ways forward is by harnessing the power of a smart contract toolkit.

Trickle provides automated, one-click, simple smart contract deployment for exactly this purpose. The interface enables anyone with an idea that would benefit from blockchain and smart contracts to release a fully formed product. And better yet, you need little to no coding knowledge.

## Why Smart Contracts Matter to Businesses and Individuals

To understand why businesses and individuals should be thinking about smart contracts, it’s worth reflecting on how significant the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry is today.

Earlier this year, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies hit $2 trillion. Even though prices have been volatile since then, the market cap remains just below the $2 trillion dollar mark. This is important because the size of a market matters to institutional investors, who have the most money to invest and only consider large, liquid asset classes. But Venture Capital investors are already piling into crypto, with $17 billion invested in the first six months of 2021.

Of course, it’s not just about the money; crypto usage is also on the up. There were 221 million crypto users around the world by June 2021 and 46 million Americans now own Bitcoin. Clearly, this is not an industry that is going away. In fact, the number of crypto users is growing faster than the number of global internet users did at the same point in the development of the World Wide Web.

The obvious next question to ask then is why this growth is happening? For this, we need to look at the key benefits of blockchain for businesses and individuals.

Decentralization is the most important of these. Almost everyone is aware that the global corporate bodies that dominate technology and finance are concentrating power and profits in the hands of the few. Distributed ledger technology removes the need for centralized power bases, while providing a secure and transparent foundation for a wider range of businesses and individuals to succeed.
Smart contracts are key to this new world. This autonomous software provides automation and efficiency benefits that can completely eliminate a whole range of middlemen and many layers of bureaucracy.
For businesses, this unlocks short-term time and cost efficiencies as well as long-term opportunities for disruptive innovation. For individuals, it provides a powerful weapon that allows them to compete at scale with much bigger but less efficient competitors.

Most significantly of all, though, developers have an enormous opportunity to benefit from smart contracts, as long as they feel able to harness their power.

## What Is Holding Development Back?

For all this innovative growth to become a reality, there needs to be a change in the way smart contracts are developed. Right now, there simply isn’t the critical mass of knowledge and expertise that is required to drive a smart contract revolution.

As we said before, smart contract development is hard. It requires coding knowledge but, more specifically, it requires knowledge of languages like Solidity that are relatively new and unfamiliar to the majority of software engineers around the world. This is why blockchain came top of a 2020 LinkedIn survey covering hard skills.

Furthermore, even when a developer does have the necessary skills to create a smart contract, they still have to consider the security implications of the code they are writing. This is because, while security matters for all application development, it is particularly important for smart contracts as they deal with the custody and transfer of valuable digital assets.

Of course, this hard work takes skill and effort. And for a business that is trying to get to market quickly, smart contract development can be a costly and frustrating affair. It’s not uncommon for a blockchain developer to command a salary of $200,000 per year and these developers are in high demand.
Crypto and blockchain listings on the jobs website ‘Indeed’ increased 118% in June 2021 compared with the year before, and this trend will have been mirrored across all sorts of recruitment channels. Furthermore, large global enterprises, such as Amazon, Apple, PayPal, and Walmart, are all known to be recruiting in this space.

These issues are major blockers to smart contract development, which will not be easy to resolve. Someone can’t just learn to code smart contracts overnight, especially when the financial implications of this software mean that they need to be fully audited and secure.

It may look as though the only option is to pay expensive salaries for new hires or contractors and hope this major investment is worthwhile. But there is a better path. Smart contract toolkits, which do not require any coding knowledge, are already audited for security and can be deployed at low cost, providing entrepreneurs and developers with a way of seizing the crypto opportunity right now.

## How a Smart Contract Toolkit Can Save You Time and Money

Software development toolkits are not a new concept. They have been used in the Web 2.0 world for some time as efficient ways of removing complexity and automating repetitive tasks in application development.

When technologies are new, they remain in the hands of those brilliant engineers who can understand the fundamentals and work around the difficulties to produce products and services that users want.

Over time though, developers who value efficiency and effectiveness attempt to smooth out these creases, so more people are able to use the technology and the rate of innovation increases. 

Essentially, this is the role of a toolkit and it is exactly what we need right now for smart contracts.
Smart contract toolkits can benefit businesses and individual developers because they allow them to reduce their time to market and seize the opportunity that crypto provides. They also have a significant role to play in the development of the industry as a whole because of the way it is evolving at the moment.

If blockchain networks powered by cryptocurrencies was stage one of this evolution, and smart contract platforms that extended the capabilities of these networks was stage two, the third and most exciting stage is development frameworks for building new blockchains from scratch.

This is where Substrate comes in. Substrate is a modular blockchain framework that contains everything you need to build your own blockchain. It is the basis of Polkadot, which is aiming to be the network that connects all blockchains through a shared security model. Therefore, Substrate provides the building blocks that many think are the most exciting parts of Web 3.0.

Right now, Substrate developers need smart contract toolkits that save them time and money, so they can build this exciting vision of the future. Substrate provides this foundation with their pallets, Rust-based programming modules made up of sets of types, trait implementations, and functions. These are contained in the FRAME library and each pallet can modify the features and functionality of your blockchain.

Trickle takes this one step further, building on the convenience of pallets to add broad utility and plug-and-play development. By using Trickle, you can skip coding altogether for new smart contracts, leaving you to focus on revenue systems and project development instead.

## How to Develop, Deploy, and Test Your Smart Contract Idea

There are businesses, entrepreneurs, and developers who want to seize these opportunities straight away. To do so, they need to move fast and the best approach is to shift from idea to Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.

Speed is crucial because the faster you can get something in front of users, the faster you can get real feedback about what is hitting the market and what needs to be improved. This can seem like a frightening process as it relies on you putting what you might consider to be an unfinished product out into the world, then potentially finding out that the idea itself is flawed.

However, the reality is that every successful startup founder has done this at some point. So, how can you do this in crypto, when you know that smart contract development is hard and hiring developers is expensive?

Once again, this is why a smart contract toolkit is important. Remember that the purpose of an MVP is to test your idea. Essentially, you are aiming for the maximum output of real user feedback from the minimum input of design and development. Therefore, a toolkit that allows you to design and deploy features for user testing, is invaluable. And the fact that you can always feel confident that your smart contract is secure and audited, is priceless.

Furthermore, once you have this sort of development toolkit at your disposal, you don’t need to just design or develop one idea. Smart contracts essentially provide an automated escrow service that executes when certain conditions are met. When you consider this from first principles, it can be applied to all sorts of areas, including real estate, exchanges, fundraising, charities, and much more.
In fact, there is no doubt that smart contracts will disrupt all these markets and a whole range of others. It’s really just a matter of who is able to get to market first and capitalize on their early advantage to build a movement.

## Using Incentives and Community to Build Engagement

If step one is your MVP, step two has to be marketing. The latter might sound like the most daunting prospect, especially if you are a developer who doesn’t see themselves as a natural promoter.

Even so, it’s important to recognize that, in a crypto industry dominated by social media memes and constant Telegram chatter, marketing your smart contract is vital. Without it, the barriers to entry that you have managed to overcome with your MVP could quickly rise up in front of you once again. Unfortunately, there are plenty of examples of well-engineered smart contracts that failed to catch on for this exact reason.

But this doesn’t have to happen. Crypto provides many more examples of smart contract projects that have become industry sensations from very humble beginnings.

Consider Uniswap. Now the biggest decentralized exchange by far, having generated over $1 billion in fees, this crypto giant started out when its inventor decided to build an automated market maker described by Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin.

That was the idea. Just a few months later, he had a smart contract that included a single liquidity provider and a mechanism for simple swaps. That was the MVP.

All of this happened back in 2017 and no-one could say that Uniswap was an overnight success. Gradually, though, it started to build traction within the Ethereum community, receiving support from the Foundation and from Vitalik himself. It also designed a key incentive mechanism that rewarded liquidity providers for making exchange markets possible.

As a result, Uniswap is one of most well-known and successful crypto projects ever, with an all-time high market capitalization of over $20 billion. It is not alone. Other DeFi projects, like Compound Finance and Yearn Finance, have managed to achieve similar levels of success and provide the blueprint for future innovators to follow.

It’s really just a matter of having the right tools at your disposal and executing without delay. By getting to market quickly, improving your idea based on user feedback, and building community momentum through incentives like staking rewards and NFTs, you too can follow in the footsteps of these crypto giants.

Trickle empowers anyone with these ambitions to succeed by removing the barriers to entry that have held them back.

By providing automated, one-click and simple smart contract deployment, it removes the need to rely on expensive middlemen and puts power in the hands of those who want to seize the potential of crypto.
