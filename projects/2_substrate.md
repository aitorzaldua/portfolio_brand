title: Substrate
description: Substrate is the perfect framework to build your blockchain. Using Substrate's palettes you can easily create whatever you want, or create your own custom logic. Either way, Substrate makes building a blockchain much faster, easier and more secure than ever. Substrate is Smart Contract Ready. It has a Wasm smart contract platform touse out of the box. Because Substrate uses Wasm, you can build your smart contracts using any compatible language. Substrate have built ink, a Rust-based eDSL, for this purpose.

## What is Substrate?

Substrate's modular design means you can reuse battle-tested libraries while building the custom components that matter most.

*Production Ready*

Substrate is the backbone that powers Polkadot, a next generation, heterogeneous, multi-chain network. Most of the blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem are also built on Substrate. The Polkadot Network was launched in May of 2020.

*Smart Contract Ready*

Substrate has a Wasm smart contract platform that you can use out of the box. Because Substrate uses Wasm, you can build your smart contracts using any compatible language. We have built ink!, a Rust-based eDSL, for this purpose.

*Teams Building on Substrate*

Some of the most exciting projects in decentralized tech are building on Substrate, including Polkadot parachains, independent layer-1 blockchains, and infrastructure and tooling solutions for a wide range of use cases.
