title: The Internet of Assets
description: Anything you can own can be represented, traded and put to use as non fungible tokens (NFT). You can tokenize your art and get royalties automatically every time it is resold. Or use a token of something you own to borrow. The possibilities just keep growing. Goodbye to the Internet of data, welcome to the Internet of value.

*The new Internet*

The Internet is entering a second age, that of the Internet of Value. The first was a convergence between computing and communication technologies. This second one feeds of a combination of cryptography, mathematics, software engineering and behavioural economics. Blockchain is the flagship disruptive technology of the second age of the Internet, and the basis of the fourth industrial revolution. So far we have always needed a third party in which two sides trust to guarantee the authenticity of transactions, whether it is a bank, an auditor, a notary or PayPal, for example, with a record or a stamp of veracity. Blockchain solves this problem by combining peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, exchanges between equals applying cryptography, and thus creating a new form of digital communication and interchange.

*The future Internet of value is mainly based on NFT*

NFTs are the value data package on the Internet of Value. It's like a bottle of water. After labeling it, the user decides what to put inside. In this case, it can have huge scalability advantages and can easily cross the chain. The smart contract does not need to know which smart contract issued the NFT to be processed. This is a very important ideological shift.
