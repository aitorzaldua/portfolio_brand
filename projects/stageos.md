title: Substrate
description: Substrate is the perfect framework to build your blockchain. Using Substrate's palettes you can easily create whatever you want, or create your own custom logic. Either way, Substrate makes building a blockchain much faster, easier and more secure than ever. Substrate is Smart Contract Ready. It has a Wasm smart contract platform touse out of the box. Because Substrate uses Wasm, you can build your smart contracts using any compatible language. Substrate have built ink, a Rust-based eDSL, for this purpose.

## Background

Stephanie brilliantly gave new life to the famous [CSS Zen Garden project](http://www.csszengarden.com/) when she created Stylestage.dev. At work I often have to find ways to redesign components that already have been given HTML, as it sometimes is with CMS-generated content, so I thought this would be a nice challenge. 

I've wanted to challenge myself to create something that's supported by most major browsers, while still doing some things out of the ordinary. I quickly landed the idea of creating a wireframed OS. Although external images was allowed I opted for using CSS gradients to create all the background patterns and OS windows. 

## Tech & tools 

I rarely do sketching before I begin my personal projects as I sometimes prefer to design with CSS. So in this case I only used the given HTML template, dug into the CSS right away and designed as I went.
