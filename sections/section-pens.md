I'm an avid user of [CodePen](https://codepen.io/havardob) and huge fan of their community. It's become somewhat a daily hobby of mine to use this platform to recreate Dribbble shots or explore the many possiblities CSS has to offer.

A few of my pens have been featured in the [CodePen Spark](https://codepen.io/spark) newsletter: 

* [Edition 177](https://codepen.io/spark/177)
* [Edition 184](https://codepen.io/spark/184)
* [Edition 193](https://codepen.io/spark/193)
* [Edition 227](https://codepen.io/spark/227)
* [Edition 233](https://codepen.io/spark/233)
* [Edition 241](https://codepen.io/spark/241)
* [Edition 250](https://codepen.io/spark/250)

One of my pens also made it into the [The Most Hearted Pens of 2020](https://codepen.io/2020/popular/pens/4) list. 

Here are some of my personal favorites.
